# Finder

Welcome to Finder! I made this application with the intention of emulating the `CTRL F` or `CMD F` functionality. It has always been my favorite keyboard shortcut, and for some reason, I have always wanted to create an app that mirrors that functionality.

This project also helped me gain more experience using javascript. If its a bit messy, apologies in advance.

## How It Works
- You will have 3 different options. You can either type in some text or upload a document, and then search for that said text using the search bar. After clicking `Enter` the app will search for your query that you entered and highlight all instances of it within the text from the uploaded document, or text that was typed in.

### User Input
- All text input by the user will be searchable

### Upload Document
- The user can upload a document from their system and all text will be searchable. Currently only .doc, .docx, .txt are supported. PDFs are not supported. 

### Website (TBI)
- This has not been done yet. The way I envison it working would be the user would insert a URL, and then the system would scrape the text off that web page and copy it onto the page. That text would then be searchable of course.

### Other Features
- You are able to change the color of the highlighter that is highlighting the text on the webpage. When doing so, be sure to click `Enter` after typing in the desired color. 


To whoever is reading this, thank you for exploring Finder. I feel like the code could be better, and am always working to improve my skills.
